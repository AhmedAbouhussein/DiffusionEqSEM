Spectral Element Method: Lagrange Interpolating Polynomials with Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre Quadrature

The one dimensional diffusion equation is solved through the Galerkian method with Lagrange interpolating polynomials as basis functions and a Gauss-Lobatto-Legendre (GLL) point distribution. Second order Adam Bashforth scheme was used for time advancement. The numerical solution is validated against an analytical solution. L2-errors indicate spectral convergence up to certain number of grid points. Please see PDF for more details.
